# Spotiplay

Spotiplay is a web application that lets users log in with their Spotify account, view their playlists and albums, and quickly add songs to their personal Spotify library. Built with Flask, htmx, Alpine.js, and the Spotify Web API, the app offers a fast and interactive non-SPA interface.

## Features

- **Spotify Login**: Users authenticate securely via Spotify OAuth.
- **Dashboard**: See your Spotify display name and profile picture, with lists of all your playlists and saved albums.
- **Playlist Details**: Click a playlist to view all its tracks.
- **Add to Library**:
  - Add *all* tracks in a playlist to your Spotify library with one click.
  - Add *individual* tracks to your library from the playlist detail page.
- **Albums**: View your saved albums with cover art and artist info.
- **Interactive UI**: All actions use htmx and Alpine.js for a dynamic, responsive experience without needing a single-page app framework.
